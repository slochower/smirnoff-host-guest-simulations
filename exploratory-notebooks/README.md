This directory contains a subset of notebooks that I used to probe the code, simulation setup, processing, and data analysis pipelines while troubleshooting issues and checking that everything was running correctly. Many of these notebooks refer to files that are not in the GitHub repository and therefore, will not run as-is. Furthermore, these notebooks may contain half-baked ideas and incorrect analysis procedures; these notebooks were not used for any of the final analysis. For those, go up one directory. They are included only in the interest of open science and posterity.
